### Context Providers

Two global context providers manage shared state:

**`AuthContext`** (`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`)
- Manages Firebase Authentication state via `onAuthStateChanged`
- Handles Google OAuth sign-in, sign-out, and token refresh
- Implements the invite-only whitelist gate (`allowed_emails` collection check)
- Resolves secondary email accounts to primary UIDs via `user_email_map`
- Exposes: `user`, `userProfile`, `effectiveUid`, `isAdmin`, `googleAccessToken`

**`TaskContext`** (`src/context/TaskContext.jsx`)
- Maintains a real-time Firestore subscription to tasks
- For admins: subscribes to all tasks via `orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')`
- For employees: runs two parallel queries (by `assignedTo` and `workPartnerUids`) and merges + deduplicates client-side
- Exposes: `tasks`, `allTasks`, `allUsers`, `loading`, `getUpcomingTasks()`

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Continue with Google" on `/login`
2. `signInWithPopup(auth, googleProvider)` opens a Google OAuth popup
3. On success, the Google access token is stored in `sessionStorage` for Calendar API use
4. `onAuthStateChanged` fires with the Firebase user
5. The `allowed_emails` collection is checked — if the email isn't whitelisted, the user is immediately signed out with an error toast
6. The `user_email_map` collection is checked for secondary email mapping
7. The user's Firestore profile is fetched or created at `users/{effectiveUid}`

### Task Assignment Flow (Admin)

1. Admin submits the Assign Task form in the Admin Panel
2. Task document is written to `tasks/` with `isAdminTask: true`
3. `addTaskToGoogleCalendar()` creates an all-day event on the admin's Google Calendar via the REST API
4. `sendNotification()` writes a notification document to `notifications/{uid}/items/` for each assignee
5. Firebase Cloud Function `onTaskCreate` fires, reads FCM tokens from user profiles, and sends push notifications via `admin.messaging().sendToDevice()`

### AI Assistant Flow

1. User sends a message in the floating chat widget
2. `sendMessage()` in `src/services/gemini.js` builds a system prompt containing the user's current task list as JSON
3. A `POST` request is made to the Vercel Serverless Function at `/api/gemini`
4. The serverless function calls the Gemini API using the server-side `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
5. The response is returned to the client and displayed in the chat widget

## Firestore Schema

### `users/{uid}`

```
{
  uid:         string   // Firebase Auth UID
  name:        string   // Display name from Google
  email:       string   // Google email
  role:        string   // "employee" | "admin"
  avatar:      string   // Google profile photo URL
  customRole:  string   // Admin-assigned display badge (optional)
  bio:         string   // Self-written bio (optional)
  phone:       string   // Phone number (optional)
  skills:      string[] // Up to 10 skill tags
  socialLinks: object   // { github, linkedin, twitter, ... }
  department:  string   // Set by admin (optional)
  designation: string   // Set by admin (optional)
  fcmToken:    string   // FCM device token for push notifications
  createdAt:   Timestamp
  updatedAt:   Timestamp
}
```

### `tasks/{taskId}`

```
{
  title:           string
  description:     string
  module:          string   // One of the aerospace modules
  priority:        string   // "high" | "medium" | "low"
  status:          string   // "pending" | "in-progress" | "completed"
  progress:        number   // 0–100
  startDate:       Timestamp
  dueDate:         Timestamp
  assignedTo:      string[] // Array of assignee UIDs
  assignedBy:      string   // Admin UID
  createdBy:       string   // Creator UID
  isAdminTask:     boolean  // false = personal self-assigned task
  workPartners:    object[] // [{ uid, name, avatar, addedBy, addedByName, addedAt }]
  workPartnerUids: string[] // Flat UID array (used by Firestore security rules only)
  links:           object[] // [{ url, label }]
  attachments:     object[] // [{ url, name }]
  completionNote:  object   // { message, completedAt, completedBy }
  isExtended:      boolean  // true if due date was extended
  createdAt:       Timestamp
  updatedAt:       Timestamp
}
```

### `tasks/{taskId}/events/{eventId}`

```
{
  type:         string  // "commit" | "partner_added" | "status_changed" | "progress_updated"
  authorUid:    string
  authorName:   string
  authorAvatar: string
  message:      string
  metadata:     object  // Type-specific payload
  createdAt:    Timestamp
}
```

### `attendance/{userId}/records/{recordId}`

```
{
  date:      string    // "YYYY-MM-DD"
  punchIn:   Timestamp
  punchOut:  Timestamp | null
  createdAt: Timestamp
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
```

## Security Model

Firestore security rules (`firestore.rules`) implement multi-layer access control:

### Key Security Functions

- **`isAuthenticated()`** — checks `request.auth != null`
- **`isEmailAllowed()`** — checks the `allowed_emails/{email}` document exists
- **`getEffectiveUid()`** — resolves secondary emails to primary UIDs via `user_email_map`
- **`isAdmin()`** — checks the user's `role` field in their Firestore profile

### Permission Matrix

| Collection | Employee | Admin |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | Read all; update own safe fields | Full CRUD |
| `tasks` | Read assigned/created; update progress/status on own | Full CRUD |
| `tasks/events` | Read/create if participant | Full CRUD |
| `announcements` | Read; update `isRead` only | Full CRUD |
| `notifications/{uid}/items` | Read/update/delete own | Create for any user |
| `attendance/{uid}/records` | Read/create/update own | Read all; delete any |
| `leaves` | Read own; create pending | Read all; update status |
| `candidates` | Read | Full CRUD |
| `performances` | Read own | Full CRUD |

## Deployment

### Vercel (Frontend + Serverless API)

The project is configured via `vercel.json` which rewrites all non-asset requests to `index.html` for SPA routing. The `/api/*` path routes to the serverless functions in the `api/` directory.

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your Vercel project's Environment Variables dashboard.

### Firebase Hosting (Alternative)

```bash
npm run build
npx firebase-tools deploy --only hosting
```

### Firebase Cloud Functions

Requires the **Blaze (pay-as-you-go)** Firebase plan.

```bash
npx firebase-tools deploy --only functions
```

Four Cloud Functions are deployed:

| Function | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `onTaskCreate` | Firestore `tasks/{taskId}` onCreate | Push notification to assignees |
| `onTaskUpdate` | Firestore `tasks/{taskId}` onUpdate | Push notification on status change |
| `onAnnouncementCreate` | Firestore `announcements/{id}` onCreate | Push notification to all users |
| `onDueDateApproach` | Pub/Sub schedule (daily 09:00 ET) | Push notification for tasks due tomorrow |

---

## Company Roadmap — Cloud Functions

Three additional Cloud Functions power the Company Roadmap module. They are defined in `functions/roadmapTriggers.js` and are **pending deploy** (Blaze plan required).

| Function | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `onRoadmapTaskWrite` | `onDocumentWritten('roadmapNodes/{nodeId}/tasks/{taskId}')` | Recomputes parent node progress rollup |
| `onRoadmapNodeWrite` | `onDocumentWritten('roadmapNodes/{nodeId}')` | Propagates progress to ancestor nodes + writes audit history |
| _(history write)_ | Internal to both above | Appends immutable audit entry to `history` subcollection via Admin SDK |

### Loop Guard

Both triggers use a `Math.round` comparison to prevent infinite cascades:

```js
if (Math.round(newProgress) === Math.round(existingProgress)) {
  // Skip write — progress hasn't meaningfully changed
  return null;
}
```

Additionally, `onRoadmapNodeWrite` detects self-triggered writes by checking whether **only** `updatedAt` / `updatedBy` changed. If so, it skips the re-propagation to break the cycle.

### Why Batched Ancestor Writes (Not Recursive Triggers)?

Progress propagation from a leaf task up to the root could be implemented as a chain of recursive triggers (each node write triggers its parent). This approach was rejected for three reasons:

1. **Infinite loop risk** — without a precise guard, `updatedAt` timestamp changes re-trigger the function indefinitely.
2. **Firestore cost amplification** — each recursive invocation is billed separately; deep trees produce O(depth) function calls per task write.
3. **Testability** — a single, deterministic function that reads all ancestors from `ancestorIds` (already stored on every node) and performs one batched pass is far easier to unit-test and reason about.

### Audit History Immutability

The `history` subcollection Firestore Rule is:

```
match /history/{historyId} {
  allow read:  if isAuthenticated() && isEmailAllowed();
  allow write: if false;   // BLOCKED for ALL clients, including admin
}
```

Cloud Functions use the **Admin SDK**, which bypasses Firestore Rules entirely. This is the only write path — history entries are therefore tamper-proof from any client.

## Company Roadmap — Permission Matrix Addendum

Additional rows for the roadmap collections (appended to the Permission Matrix table above):

| Collection | Employee | Admin |
|---|---|---|
| `roadmapNodes` | Read all | Full CRUD |
| `roadmapNodes/{id}/tasks` | Read own assigned; update `status`/`progress`/`completionNote` only | Full CRUD |
| `roadmapNodes/{id}/comments` | Read all; create own (authorUid check); delete own | Full CRUD |
| `roadmapNodes/{id}/history` | Read only | Read only (write blocked — Cloud Function only) |
| `roadmapNodes/{id}/attachments` | Read all; create/update/delete own | Full CRUD |
